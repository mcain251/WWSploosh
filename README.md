# WWSploosh
An application to help with the Sploosh-Kaboom (Battleship) minigame in the Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.
Positions are from the top left of the board and describe the upper-left space of the squid.
Orientations are 0= right-left, 1 = up-down.
Big = 4 spaces, med = 3, sml = 2.
For history, 0 = unknown, 1 = miss, 2 = hit.
For squids, 0,1,2 = big params (x,y,orientation), 3,4,5 = mid params, 6,7,8 = sml params.
For the board display, X = hit, O = miss, B = best (if you are in seeBoard mode, i = squid, I = best & squid).
